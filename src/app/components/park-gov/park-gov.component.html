The Government Hill Parks and Trails Plan will identify and prioritize future investments in parks and recreation
facilities in the Government Hill neighborhood for the next 20 years. This project builds upon the 2013 Government Hill
Neighborhood Plan and is intended to serve as a vehicle for implementation of parks and trails goals outlined in the
Neighborhood Plan.
